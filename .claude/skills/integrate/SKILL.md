description: Absorb one lecture's raw notes into the structured chapter/section hierarchy of these lecture notes. Use when the user has just taken notes in a throwaway "Lecture <date>" section and wants them redistributed by topic, matching the existing expository style, boxed environments, numbering, and labels. Triggers on "/integrate", "integrate my notes", "integrate today's lecture", "fold in the last lecture".

# Integrating a lecture into the notes

Raw notes are taken linearly, in lecture order. The notes themselves are organized
by topic. This skill is the translation between the two: it takes one lecture's
worth of unsorted material and distributes it into the right chapters, sections and
subsections, writing whatever connecting prose is needed to make the result read as
though it had always been there.

Read these first; everything below assumes them.

- `CLAUDE.md` — build commands, preamble layout, authoring conventions.
- `.claude/STYLE.md` — the voice, the LaTeX mechanics, the label scheme and the macro
  conventions, with pointers into the author's other notes repositories when a
  question is not settled there.
- `.claude/ORGANIZATION.md` — what earns a chapter, a section and a subsection, and
  the format of `TOPICS.md`. Here it is a **constraint**, not a target: it tells you
  whether this lecture's material fits an existing section or has earned one of its
  own. Making the document match it is `/organize`'s job, not yours.

## The staging convention

A raw lecture lives as an ordinary section file inside the chapter that was current
during the lecture:

```
Chapters/1_Logic/1_4_Lecture_0824.tex     <- raw; \section{Lecture 2026-08-24}
```

Recognize a raw file by `Lecture_` in its basename. It is `\input` by its chapter
file like any other section, so the notes always compile. **Integration dissolves
it**: its content is redistributed and the file and its `\input` line are removed.

If the user names a file or a date, use that. Otherwise glob
`Chapters/**/*Lecture_*.tex`; if exactly one exists, that is the target. If several
exist, list them and ask which to integrate — do not guess, and do not integrate
several at once unless asked.

**If no staging file exists**, the convention was not followed: the lecture was
written straight into a real section file, or into a template-named one such as
`1_1_Imp_Defs.tex`. Do not stop. Identify the file holding the unintegrated material,
say which file you are treating as the staging file and why, and proceed — the
ledger, the plan and the report all work the same way. The only difference is at the
end: the file is not deleted, because it is a real section file. Its *contents* are
redistributed and whatever is left of it is either a legitimate section or is emptied
and removed. If you cannot tell which material is unintegrated, ask rather than
guess.

**If the notes contain nothing to integrate into** — a first lecture, or a repository
still all template placeholders — then there is no integration to do, and the right
skill is `/organize`: the task is arranging one lecture's material sensibly, not
folding it into an existing arrangement. Say so and stop.

## There is no syllabus

**No list of topics for the course will ever be provided.** Nobody knows what
`Chapters/` should eventually look like — not the user, not you. That single fact
drives most of the judgment calls in this skill:

- `TOPICS.md` is a **record of what the lectures have actually covered**, not a plan
  derived from a syllabus. Never invent sections for topics no lecture has reached
  because a course like this "usually" covers them.
- The chapter and section structure is therefore **provisional**, and stays
  provisional. Early lectures land in whatever chapter looked right at the time; by
  lecture ten it may be obviously wrong. That is expected. It is also not yours to
  fix — see the boundary below.
- What you *may* do is infer where things seem to be heading from the lecture itself
  — a result stated but not proved, a definition introduced for later use, an
  explicit "we'll come back to this". Record those under `## Signposted` in
  `TOPICS.md`, clearly marked as the lecturer's signposting rather than as structure.
  They are the closest thing to a syllabus that exists.

## Scope: this skill does not restructure

`/integrate` and `/organize` share their format, their guiding principles and their
respect for the author's mathematics. They do not share a scope.

| | `/integrate` | `/organize` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Input | one lecture's raw notes | the notes as they already stand |
| Adds material | yes, that is the point | never |
| Restructures | only enough to house the new material | yes, that is the point |
| `TOPICS.md` | appends its own entries | owns the file |
| Ends with | the raw file dissolved | the same content, better arranged |

**Restructuring what already exists is out of scope here.** Concretely, you may:

- create a new section or subsection for material that has nowhere to go, sized
  according to `ORGANIZATION.md`;
- adjust a heading title that *this lecture's material* has made inaccurate;
- add a cross-reference in either direction between new and existing material.

You may not: move settled material between sections or chapters, split or merge
existing headings, rename or split a chapter, promote a subsection to a section, or
renumber anything that was already in place. Those are `/organize`'s, and they are
out of scope even when they are obviously right, because they renumber results and
the author has to review the fallout.

When you see one — a chapter whose title stopped describing its contents three
lectures ago, a section doing the work of three —
**record it and recommend `/organize`**. Note it under a `## Structural pressure`
heading in `TOPICS.md` and raise it in the report. A wedged-in placement that you have
flagged is recoverable; a unilateral reorganization buried in an integration diff is
not.

## Procedure

### 1. Build the ledger

Before changing anything, enumerate **every** discrete piece of the raw file into a
checklist: each theorem-like environment, each displayed derivation, each figure or
TikZ picture, each paragraph of prose, each aside. Give every item a short handle
and quote its opening words. Keep this ledger for the rest of the run. It is the
only guard against silently dropping something, and the raw file is deleted at the
end, so an unledgered item is a lost item.

### 2. Read the surrounding notes

- `TOPICS.md` — the running topic map (see below). The primary placement authority.
- `.claude/ORGANIZATION.md` — the generality ladder, which decides whether this
  lecture's material joins an existing section or earns a new one. The question is
  conceptual, not dimensional: material that continues an existing line of enquiry
  becomes a subsection of that section however much of it there is, and only material
  asking a different question earns a section of its own.
- `.claude/STYLE.md` — the house style, and the corpus it points at. If you have not
  read a real section of the notes end to end in this session, read two now; the
  voice does not transfer from a description of it.
- `main.tex` — chapter order and which chapters are commented out.
- Every chapter file, and any section file the ledger might touch.
- `TeX_Setup/shortcuts.tex` and `TeX_Setup/environments.tex` — the available macro
  and environment vocabulary. Grep these before writing raw math; the notes have a
  house macro for most things.

### 3. Plan, and get it approved

Produce a plan and **stop for confirmation before writing anything**. The plan states,
for each ledger item, where it goes and why; then separately lists

- new sections or subsections to create, with their titles,
- existing material to be moved, quoting what and from where to where,
- new linking prose to be written, with a sentence on what each passage will argue,
- anything you cannot place confidently.

Placement is editorial judgment and the user is the editor. Never skip this step,
even when the answer looks obvious.

For items you genuinely cannot place, prefer parking them over guessing: leave them
in a clearly-marked holding section and record them under `## Unplaced` in
`TOPICS.md`. A wrong confident placement is worse than a flagged one.

### 4. Apply

Working rules, in order of importance:

**Never lose or alter mathematics.** Definitions, theorem/lemma/proposition
statements, and proofs move *verbatim* — copy them, do not retype or paraphrase them.
If a statement seems wrong or incomplete, move it unchanged and flag it in the report;
do not fix it silently.

**Rewrite freely at the level of connective tissue.** Transitions, motivating
sentences, section titles and ordering are yours to adjust so the result reads
continuously. This is the whole point of the skill — a purely additive integration
would leave the notes a pile of lectures.

**Never delete a statement.** Not a duplicate, not a triviality, not an aside. If two
lectures state the same result, merge them into one environment, keep the stronger or
better-worded statement, and say so in the report.

#### Expository style, in brief

`.claude/STYLE.md` is the full account and takes precedence over this summary. The
parts that bite hardest during an integration:

- **Every boxed environment gets a one-sentence bridge before it.** This is the most
  visible signature of the notes and the thing a raw lecture file most reliably
  lacks. "We have a special term for Lie algebras whose derived series stabilizes at
  $0$." / "There is also a less trivial example." / "The following is thus obvious."
  One clause of signposting, then the box. Writing these is most of the work.
- **First-person plural, colloquial but not chatty.** "We begin by…", "Next, we…",
  "It turns out that…". Dry humor where it lands naturally ("Here's a cool result.")
  and nowhere else. American spelling: *coloring*, *neighborhood*, *generalization*.
- **Boxed environments always** — `boxdefinition`, `boxtheorem`, `boxlemma`,
  `boxexample`, … (`CLAUDE.md` has the family). Raw notes are written loosely;
  converting them is expected. Definitions carry a title, `[Derived Series]`; results
  usually do not. `\hfill` after `\begin{box…}` or `\begin{proof}` when the body
  opens with a list. `\textbf{}` the term being defined, in the definition body.
- **`align*` for every display**, even one-liners. One paragraph per source line, no
  hard wrapping — and never reflow a line you were not otherwise changing.
- **Case splits use `description`** with `\item[\underline{Case…}]` or
  `\item[$\parenth{\implies}$]`.
- **Replace ad-hoc math with house macros:** `\parenth`, `\set`, `\setst`, `\abs`,
  `\floor`, `\ceil`, `\R`, `\Z`, `\N`, `\pgcd`, `\Sym`, … Grep `shortcuts.tex`
  first; it almost always already has one. A genuinely new one is appended to the
  `% SET THEORY` block following the existing naming conventions, never
  defined inline.
- **Mark a gap the lecture left** — a proof not given, a case not covered, an argument
  that simply stops — with `\sorry`. Do not quietly fill it with a hand-wave, and do
  not work it out yourself: marking is your job, and `/fill-sorries` is the skill that
  closes them. An unmarked gap is one nobody will come back for.

Then, mechanically:

- One file per section, named `<chapter>_<section>_<Topic>.tex`, `\input` from the
  chapter file in reading order. Quote paths: directory names may contain spaces.
- Labels are `Ch<N>:<Kind>:<Name>` — `Def`, `Thm`, `Prop`, `Lemma`, `Cor`, `Eg`,
  `CEg`, `Eq`, `Sec`, `Subsec` — with chapters as `Ch<N>:CH`; see `STYLE.md` for the
  full table. **Label only what is actually referenced**; most environments in the
  notes carry no label. Cross-reference with `\Cref` (capital C — `\cref` appears
  nowhere in the notes), and add references both ways when a new result depends on
  an older one.
- Remember results are numbered per *section*, so moving a theorem across a section
  boundary renumbers it. Grep for stale `\Cref`s to anything you moved.
- Delete the raw file and its `\input` line last, once every ledger item is placed.

### 5. Append to TOPICS.md

`ORGANIZATION.md` specifies the format and `/organize` owns the file. Your job is to
**append, not to rewrite**: a line for each section this lecture put material in,
dated; new entries under `## Signposted` for what the lecture pointed at without
reaching; anything you could not place under `## Unplaced`. Leave the outline's shape,
the inference note and the existing annotations alone.

If you find yourself wanting to rewrite the outline rather than add to it, that is
the signal that this lecture has broken the structure. Add your entries where they
least distort it, note the problem under `## Structural pressure`, and recommend
`/organize` in the report.

Create the file on first run if it is absent, following the format in
`ORGANIZATION.md`. Every line must be traceable to a lecture: a section exists in
`TOPICS.md` because a lecture put material in it, or because the lecturer explicitly
said we would come back to it, never because the topic is one a course on this
subject would normally reach.

```
<!-- No syllabus for this course. Structure is inferred from lectures and revised
     as they arrive. Currently reads as: the basic objects first, with <the running
     thread> as the thread tying them together; <later topic> may want its own
     chapter. -->

## 1. <Chapter Title>  -> Chapters/1_Intro/
  1.1 <Section Title>        [<date>]

## Signposted
  <result the lecturer stated and did not prove> — posed <date>, left open

## Unplaced
  <topic> (mentioned <date>)

## Structural pressure
  1.1 is doing the work of three sections [noted <date>] — three separate lines of
  enquiry under one heading. Run /organize.
```

If this run's material makes the existing structure wrong rather than incomplete,
record it under `## Structural pressure` with what you observed, and recommend
`/organize` in the report. Do not act on it here: renaming a chapter renumbers every
label under it, and that belongs in a diff of its own.

### 6. Verify

1. **Ledger check** — walk the ledger and name the file and section each item landed
   in. Anything unaccounted for is a bug; find it before continuing.
2. **Build** — `latexmk -pdf -outdir=TeX_Outputs main.tex`. It must compile. Check
   the log for undefined references and duplicate labels, which are the usual
   symptoms of a botched move.
3. Refresh the committed `TeX_Outputs/main.pdf` (it is tracked deliberately).

### 7. Branch, commit, PR

Never integrate directly on `main`.

```bash
git checkout -b integrate/<lecture-date>
git add -A && git commit    # subject: "Integrate lecture of <date>"
git push -u origin integrate/<lecture-date>
```

If the push fails on credentials, the remote is HTTPS but the machine may only have
an SSH key. Retry once over SSH without rewriting the remote:

```bash
git push git@github.com:thefundamentaltheor3m/SetTheoryNotes.git HEAD:refs/heads/integrate/<lecture-date>
```

Then **always attempt the PR** — `gh` is present on some of the user's machines and
not others, so check rather than assume:

```bash
gh auth status                  # gh installed and authenticated?
gh pr create --base main --title "Integrate lecture of <date>" --body-file <file>
```

Write the body to a file rather than passing `--body` inline, so the report survives
shell quoting, and do not use `--fill` — the commit message is not a substitute for
the placement rationale a reviewer needs. The body should carry the substance of the
report below: where each group of material went, what existing content moved or was
rewritten, and anything left unplaced.

With `gh` available, use the rest of it too:

- `gh pr view --web` to hand the user a live link, and `gh pr diff` to sanity-check
  the diff you just produced.
- `gh pr checks --watch` to follow the LaTeX build the PR triggers
  (`.github/workflows/publish-latex.yml`). If it fails, read the log with
  `gh run view --log-failed` and fix it on the branch — a red build on `main` breaks
  the published PDF.
- `gh pr edit --add-label` / `gh pr comment` for anything worth flagging separately,
  such as a result you moved but are unsure about.

If `gh` is missing or unauthenticated, say so plainly and print the compare URL
instead — do not treat that as a failure of the integration:

```
https://github.com/thefundamentaltheor3m/SetTheoryNotes/compare/main...integrate/<date>
```

## Report back

Close with: where each group of material went; every existing passage you moved or
rewrote, and why; the linking prose you added; anything left unplaced or flagged;
and the build result. Be specific about the edits to existing content — those are
the ones the user most needs to check, and burying them defeats the propose-then-apply
step.

## Leftover template scaffolding

A repository cut from [Lecture-Notes-Template-2026][tpl] starts out as nothing but
scaffolding, and the first few integrations happen while it is still standing:

```
Chapters/0_Overview.tex                     one template sentence
Chapters/1_Intro/1_1_Imp_Defs.tex           placeholder section
Chapters/1_Intro/1_2_Another_Section.tex    placeholder section
Chapters/2_Another Chapter/                 placeholder chapter, two placeholder sections
Chapters/Appendices/                        placeholder, \input commented out in main.tex
```

Offer to clear whichever ones are actually in your way — but ask first, and never
delete a file that has acquired real content. The rest is a structural problem
rather than an integration one, so leave it and recommend `/organize`.

Note that `Chapters/1_Intro/` is **not** a misnomer once chapter 1 acquires a real
title. `1_Intro` is the author's directory name for chapter 1 across three of the
four sibling repositories — including ones whose chapter 1 is titled *A Recap of
Undergraduate Topology* and *Character Theory* — so it is a convention rather than
template residue. Leave it alone.
